# Rappi Crowdlending App
Ordinary Rappi users who want to invest some savings and self-employed who want to work and make money. Everybody wins! 
This project was born after identifying the need of many Couriers who make their deliveries by bicycle to improve their work, their well-being and their productivity with a motorcycle, which becomes a tool, not only for their work with Rappi, but for their lives.  Imagine working 8 hours a day doing deliveries  around the city by bicycle and motorcycle, which option seems more humane?
